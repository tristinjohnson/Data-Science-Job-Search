# An Analysis of the Job Search for Data Scientist's

This website includes a complete analysis regarding over 3,900 different Data Science jobs that are posted on Glassdoor.com. The main aspects in which I will be doing an analysis on will be regarding the different job titles in this dataset, the different salaries that are offered to Data Scientists, the companies who are hiring the most, along with several aspects into the location of the position.

As a soon to be Data Scientist myself, I have recently been active in the job search and trying to find a position that meets the requirements I set in place for a good job. However, I am still quite unsure what specific job or area of expertise in which I would like to enter, along with the fact that I am unsure about the salaries of different leveled positions. That's why I created this website. For any Data Scientist looking to get some information regarding the job search in such a new and fulfilling field.
